                    <h2>Technique: Differential Relaxation (Active Muscle Deactivation)</h2>
                    <p>Under academic pressure, the body unconsciously activates postural muscles—shoulders, upper back, jaw—creating a “threat brace.” These muscles stay contracted for hours, even when you don’t need them. Differential Relaxation teaches the brain to keep <strong>task-irrelevant muscles OFF</strong> while <strong>task-relevant muscles work normally</strong> (eyes/hands). This interrupts chronic tension loops.</p>
            
                    <h3>Protocol:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Visual Cue:</strong> Place a small sticker on your laptop screen or diary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cue-Triggered Release:</strong> Every time the sticker enters your awareness, immediately drop both shoulders by 1–2 inches and loosen the jaw.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check:</strong> Ask, “Am I lifting my shoulders like I’m holding up the ceiling?”</li>
                        <li><strong>Micro-Relaxation:</strong> Exhale sharply and let your shoulders “fall.”</li>

                    <h2>Technique: Interoceptive Exposure + Cognitive Diffusion</h2>
                    <p>Fear of losing control comes from misinterpreting bodily sensations as dangerous. Exposure teaches these sensations are safe.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Safe Sensation Exposure:</strong> Spin in a chair 20 seconds; run in place to elevate heartbeat; notice nothing dangerous occurs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cognitive Diffusion:</strong> Say the thought in a silly voice (“I am losing control!”) to detach from it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Label Sensations:</strong> “This is adrenaline, not danger.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay-in-the-Moment Rule:</strong> Do not escape; let sensation peak (90 seconds) and fall naturally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Fear response collapses → sense of control increases.</li>

                        <li><strong>Catastrophe Exposure (Imaginal):</strong> Write out feared scenario (“I faint in class”), read aloud for 5 minutes until anxiety drops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Body Scan Reality Check:</strong> Check: Can I walk? Breathe? Swallow? Re-anchors in physical safety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Breathing Reset:</strong> Long exhale-oriented breathing (5s out, 3s in) → calms amygdala.</li>

                        <li>Brain learns: self-doubt → no reward → behavior reduces.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Choose a strict cutoff time (e.g., 9:00 PM).</li>
                    <li>At that time: close work, hide materials, switch to night mode.</li>
                    <li>No exceptions.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>Reward (TV, dessert) only if you stop exactly at cutoff time.</li>
                    <li>If you continue even 5 minutes, no reward.</li>
                    <li>Reinforces stopping behavior.</li>

                    <li>When urge to hide appears → do the opposite.</li>
                    <li>Example: Sit in living room for 10 minutes.</li>
